<p>My major and continuing project as a fellow at the CFPB has been to refresh <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/">consumerfinance.gov</a>. It’s a complete overhaul—a refresh of visuals, architecture and content. Our main goals with the refresh are to make the site fully responsive for mobile, to build it from templatable modules so any new page can be built quickly and maintain a strong visual consistency, and to update the visual brand of the CFPB into a brighter, more consumer-focused look. </p>

<p>Here's what the current homepage looks like:</p>

<a href="static/img/cf.gov/cfCurrent.jpg"><img alt="CFPB current homepage" src="static/img/cf.gov/cfCurrent.jpg"></a>

<p>Here's our plan for the homepage refresh:</p>

<p>We’re in the first rounds of our build phase and we hope to roll out pieces of the site publicly in a few weeks. Find out more by checking out the preview site I built <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://ell0ell0.github.io/ConsumerFinance.gov-preview/">here</a>.</p>

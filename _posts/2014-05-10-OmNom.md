<p>OmNom was developed for a class in physical computing (pcom). Our only restrictions were that we needed to use an LCD screen and at least two sensors. Our pcom lab was a disaster. Resistors, trash and leftovers littered the room, so I set out to make a trash can that would encourage the other students to clean up a bit more.</p>

<p>I sketched out my idea as a storyboard and showed it to a few people. It was ridiculous but people seemed to like it, so I set out to antropomorphize a trash can!</p>

<p>I tackled the biggest technical hurdle first: the screen and mouth.</p>

<p>After that I quickly assembled the rest of the pieces in a temporary housing to begin testing as soon as I could.</p>

<p>People seemed to get a kick out of Omnom, and as long as the batteries lasted, the pcom lab became noticeably less messy. I also observed a lot of people petting Omnom after using him, so I installed a vibration sensor so he could respond when a user petted his head.</p>

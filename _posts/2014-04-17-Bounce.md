<p>Bounce is a visual music composing app I designed and developed for my master's thesis. A user draws shapes/sounds, balls can be placed and directed, and once the ball strikes a shape, the sound is triggered. The user can also choose to tap shapes to activate them manually. The app is not publicly available on the iTunes store; it is merely a functional prototype. For now the app acts as a midi controller sending OSC messages to <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/new-in-9/">Abelton Live</a>, an extremely robust desktop music production application. Check out the video below for a demonstration.</p>

<p>Bounce was built with <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">openframeworks</a>, a C++ toolkit for creative coding. </p>

<p>The video below is a tutorial demonstrating how to control the app.</p>

<p>In the end I believe I reached too far with Bounce. As a thesis and research project it was a success. I tried to create a full-fledged visual music composition application—a tall order. It was a novel system with some unique interactions, but all in all, too complicated for casual users and not robust enough for professionals. Perhaps I should have focused more on what made my original prototype (see below) so compelling in the first place.</p>

<p>It was a simpler concept, with far fewer options and only percussive sounds. Perhaps a gamified version would have been better. A sort of emergent sound toy a la Breakout?</p>

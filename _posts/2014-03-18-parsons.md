<p>While working on my masters degree at <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/">Parsons</a> I was asked to help finish the development of the Parsons iPad app. <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.cre8ive.kr/blog/">Dong Yoon Park</a> deserves a ton of credit here. He created the iPhone app and got most of the iPad version under way before he graduated. He literally wrote a <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.yes24.com/24/goods/4604135">book</a> (in Korean) on developing for IOS. I followed his patterns and code and essentially did a ton of content additions, gathering and implementing gobs of imagery, creating and implementing charts, setting text, adding a few buttons and menus, and doing my best to learn and hack together some objective-c.</p>

<p>Feel free to <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/parsons-new-school-for-design/id467670123?mt=8">download</a> the app for free from the app store.</p>

<p>While working on my masters degree at <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/">Parsons</a> I was asked to help finish up the development of the Parsons iPad app. <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.cre8ive.kr/blog/">Dong Yoon Park</a> deserves a ton of credit here. He created the iPhone app and got most of the iPad version underway before he graduated. I simply finished up where he left off. He literally wrote a <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.yes24.com/24/goods/4604135">book</a> (in Korean) on developing for IOS. I followed his patterns and code and essentially just did a ton of content additions, gathering and implementing gobs of imagery, creating and implementing charts, setting text, added a few buttons and menus here and there, and did my best to learn and hack together some objective-c. </p>

<p>Surface is an interactive installation that reduces the immense scale of Beijing into an intimate and individual experience.</p>

<p>Each person has an influence on their urban environment, and the greater city impacts each individual in turn. Surface reflects that experience by transforming a map of Beijing, enormous in scale, onto each individual's face, creating a digital mask that combines person and urban environment.</p>

<p>Surface was created for Beijing Design Week in 2012 by myself, Lara Warman, Caitlin Morris, and Yu Tong in a little under a week. We utilized <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">openframeworks</a>, a C++ toolkit for creative coding, with some open souce computer vision code.</P>

<p>Bounce is a visual music composing app I designed and developed for my masters thesis. A user draws shapes / sounds, balls can be placed and directed and once they strike a shape the sound is triggered. The user can also choose to tap shapes to activate them manually. The app is not publicly available on the iTunes store, it is merely a functional prototype. For now the app acts as a midi controller sending OSC messages to <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="https://www.ableton.com/en/live/new-in-9/">Abelton Live</a>, an extremely robust desktop music production application. Check out the video below for a demonstration.</p>

<p>Bounce was built with <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/">openframeworks</a>, a C++ toolkit for creative coding. </p>

<p>The video below is a tutorial demonstrating how to control the app.</p>

<p>In the end I believe I reached too far with Bounce. As a thesis and research project it was a success. I tried to create a full fledged visual music composition application, quite a tall order. It was a novel system with some unqiue interactions, but all in all too complicated for casual users and not robust enough for proffesionals. Perhaps I should have focused more on what made my original prototype (see below) so compelling in the first place.</p>

<p>It was a simpler concept, with far fewer options and only percussive sounds. Perhaps a gamified version would have been better. A sort of emergent sound toy ala breakout?</p>

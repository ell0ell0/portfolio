<p>FYI: I lost all of physical copies and backup hard drive when my apartment was flooded in hurricane Sandy. I've only recently realized i no longer had anything from my time there, so I’m waiting to get issues and flats sent to me. The images you see on this page I’ve pulled from random sources on the internet and represent some work and these images are pretty poor quality. I apologize in the mean time and I’ll update as soon as I can.</p>

<p>I worked as an assistant art director at <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.runnersworld.com/">Runner's World magazine</a>  from fall 2008 – summer 2010. I oversaw designed and art directed nearly all of the front and back of the book (pretty much everything that isn’t a feature) as well as doing an occasional feature story. Every month was a race to produce design, art direct and produce an entire magazines worth of content without ever sacrificing quality. </p>

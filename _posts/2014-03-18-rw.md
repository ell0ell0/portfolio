<p>(I lost all my physical copies and a backup hard drive in Hurricane Sandy. I’m waiting to get issues and flats sent to me. I’ve pulled the images on this page from random sources on the internet, hence the poor quality. I’ll update as soon as I can.)</p>

<p>I worked as an assistant art director at <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.runnersworld.com/">Runner's World magazine</a> from fall 2008 to summer 2010. I oversaw, designed and art-directed nearly all of the front and back of the book as well as doing an occasional feature story. Every month was a race (pun intended) to design, art-direct and produce an entire issue without ever sacrificing quality. </p>

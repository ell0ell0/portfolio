<p>My major and continuing project as a fellow at the CFPB has been part of a team to refresh the <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/">consumerfinance.gov</a>. It’s a complete overhaul, visual refresh, information architecture refresh and content refresh. Our large goals with the refresh is to make the site fully responsive for mobile, to build it from templatable modules so any new page can be built quickly and maintain a strong visual consistency, and to update the visual brand of the CFPB into a brighter more consumer focused look. </p>

<p>Here's what the current homepage looks like.</p>

<p>Here's our plan for the homepage refresh.</p>

<p>Currently we’re in the first rounds of our build phase and will hopefully be rolling out pieces of the site publicly in a few weeks. You can find out a bit more by checking out the preview site I built <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://ell0ell0.github.io/ConsumerFinance.gov-preview/">here</a>.</p>

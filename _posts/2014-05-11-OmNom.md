<p>OmNom was developed in a for a class in physical computing (pcom). Our only restrictions where we needed to utilize a LCD screen and at least two sensors. Our pcom lab was a disaster. Resitors, trash, leftovers, etc littered the room, so I set out to try and make a trash can that'd encourage the other students to clean up a bit more...</p>

<p>I sketched out my idea as a storyboard and showed to a few people. it was ridiculous but people seemed to like it, so I set out to antropomorphize a trash can!</p>

<p>I tackled the biggest technical hurdle first, the screen and mouth.</p>

<p>After that I quickly assembled the rest of the pieces in a temporary housing to begin testing as soons as I could.</p>

<p>People seemed to really get a kick out of Omnom and as long as the batteries lasted the pcom lab was becoming noticeably less a mess. I also observed a lot people petting Omnom after using him, so I installed a vibration sensor so he could give a response when a user pet his head.</p>

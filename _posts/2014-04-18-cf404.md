<p>Currently we're in full build phase for consumerfinance.gov. We're working in Agile method, but Agile doesn't quite take design into consideration. Some sprints desing finishes extremely quickly for pages, so we have global tasks we can work on in those spaces. For me one of them has been our 404 page.</P>

<p>Nobody wants to arrive at a 404, so I wanted to turn the negative experience of finding a broken link into something more akin to discovering an easter egg. I adapted the brand "beam" from the CFPB logo and turned it into an interaction, a flashlight that the user can use to investigate the page.</p>

<p>Anytime I have a bit of downtime I add some more illustrations. I'd like to have the illustration continue scrolling down through the earths core, back out the other side of the planet, and continue on into space.</p>

<p>Currently we're in full build phase for consumerfinance.gov. We're working in an Agile environment, but Agile doesn't quite take design into consideration. During sprints, design often finishes ahead of schedule, so we have global tasks to work on. For me one of them has been our 404 page.</P>

<p>Nobody wants to arrive at a 404, so I wanted to turn the negative experience of finding a broken link into something more akin to discovering an Easter egg. I adapted the brand "beam" from the CFPB logo and turned it into an interaction, a flashlight that the user can use to investigate the page.</p>

<p>Whenever I have downtime, I add more illustrations. I'd like to have the illustration continue scrolling down through the earth's core, back out the other side of the planet, and on into space.</p>

<p>One of my first projects as a fellow at the <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/">Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</a> (CFPB) was to work with a team to redesign the complaint forms for consumers. If the bureau only provided a single service to the American public it would be their ability to receive and assist in resolving <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/">complaints</a> about consumer financial products. It’s not only a powerful tool for users to find some resolution to their grievances against financial products or services, but contributes to the CFPB’s database which allows them to spot patterns abuse for which they can take action or inform their rule writing and regulation. The original form, which is still in use for some products, was developed by a contractor and was about as bare bones as could possibly be (see image below).</p>

<p>There was nowhere to go but up from here. We identified multiple avenues to improve the experience and quality of information being gathered. There need to be clearer organization, a lot more explanatory text to add context, and far more feedback for each form field in terms of success and failure states. Visually we made the forms appear far friendly, with clearer hierarchy of information and more closely aligned the look with the CFPB’s brand. </p>

<p>With the forms that have been rolled out with our redesign completion rates nearly 40% higher than the original forms and there are far fewer text fields filled in with the wrong information. In addition we've advised the bureau as a whole to phase out their current database in order to allow for the development of a single intelligent complaint form to. Often users input their complaints in the wrong form, such as when they write their complaint in a mortgage form when their complaint is really about a harrasing debt collector aassociated with their mortgage.</p>

<p>While completing my masters degree at <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://www.newschool.edu/parsons/">Parsons</a>, I was contracted to create a poster for their PLAYTECH event. PLAYTECH is a Design and Technology event where a select number of Parsons students in DT undergraduate and graduate programs present their game projects / interactive work to youth enrolled in the Parsons Pre-College Academy program and other visiting youth from various New York organizations.</p>

<p>The display typography is based off the typeface Gotham. I collaged the history of gaming hardware, peripherals, and equipment into the type before reducing the image to outlines.</p>

<p>One of the clients I had the privilege of working with during my time at Time Inc. Content Solutions was Massachusetts General Hospital. The people we worked with there were all intimidatingly intelligent and they always pushed us to be far more creative and conceptual than any other client Iâ€™ve worked with. Together we published a magazine called <a class="theme-txt-orange" href="http://protomag.com/">Proto</a>. The magazine's goal is to present groundbreaking medicine and research to a general audience. We never had to dumb down the content but instead had think of compelling ways to talk about the science in an understandable way. From stories about why animals are still being used in research, to the science of taste, to new robotic surgery methods, every article was extremely interesting and a fun challenge to design, art-direct and conceptualize.</p>
